      <description>&lt;p&gt;Domino (the app final name is still under research and development) is an app created to enhance one&amp;rsquo;s experience of going outside. Let&amp;rsquo;s define a new term called &lt;em&gt;instant tourism&lt;/em&gt; by looking into what the app offers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The app is centered around a main function, placing activities on a map. Whenever you are going to the skatepark with friends, attending an old car gathering or even sipping a drink near the beach, you are free to share this activity by placing a pin on the map and describing few information&amp;hellip; The goal is to motivate people to go outside and do activites they would have never done otherwise. It works best when in a foregn country or travelling to a place you haven&amp;rsquo;t meticulously prepared your tight planning. It gives you hints on where to eat, what to do, or find exceptional events on a 2h time-frame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
