    <h1>Domino, share your activity, get motivated</h1>

    

    <p>Domino (the app final name is still under research and development) is an app created to enhance one&rsquo;s experience of going outside. Let&rsquo;s define a new term called <em>instant tourism</em> by looking into what the app offers.</p>
<p>The app is centered around a main function, placing activities on a map. Whenever you are going to the skatepark with friends, attending an old car gathering or even sipping a drink near the beach, you are free to share this activity by placing a pin on the map and describing few information&hellip; The goal is to motivate people to go outside and do activites they would have never done otherwise. It works best when in a foregn country or travelling to a place you haven&rsquo;t meticulously prepared your tight planning. It gives you hints on where to eat, what to do, or find exceptional events on a 2h time-frame.</p>
<p>The <em>instant</em> in instant tourism comes from this last rule. The pins created will look bigger on the map if it&rsquo;s liked by the community but will be forced to disappear after 2h, bringing light to other less famous activities or more time-limited events.</p>
<p>Questions not answered yet, feel free to share ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>artistic direction (mostly name and color palette, the logo is done)</li>
<li>how to moderate pin from the community ?</li>
<li>will the app mainly focus on friends (lower customer retention this way, no need to moderate)</li>
<li>how to properly use map data, have few hints</li>
<li>any KYC or phone number to better identify and block prohibited behaviors ?</li>
</ul>
