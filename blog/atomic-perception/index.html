    <h1>Atomic perception</h1>

    

    <p>The other day, I was listening to a podcaster named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theo.lelion">Theo Lion</a>, who has a series of videos discussing his entrepreneurial journey. He backs his thoughts with knowledge gained from books.</p>
<p>I am not a passionate book lover, but I understood why—I&rsquo;ve never had the chance to read an interesting book. I realized this statement when I started reading Atomic Habits, which Theo Lion recommended. In this first blog post, I will discuss some elements that have helped me become a better person. Understanding key concepts of habits and contextualizing them with personal experiences is essential for becoming more efficient. Let&rsquo;s dive into it.</p>
<p>Small lessons are easier to remember because shorter content is easier to relate to. I will present quotes from the book and share my thoughts on them.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Winners and loosers have the same goal. Focus on the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a football competition, both winners and losers share the same goal, but only one team achieves it. This shows that being goal-oriented alone isn’t enough to accomplish complex tasks. Setting a reminder on your phone that says, &lsquo;Goal: become fit,&rsquo; is an example of focusing solely on the end goal. What’s more effective is improving the system you operate in—it&rsquo;s the path to the goal that truly matters. By focusing on becoming a better football team through increased training, stronger cohesion, and overall improvement, your team is more likely to achieve its objectives.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote mirrors the previous one. It emphasizes that the most efficient way to achieve results is by analyzing the initial efforts, identifying their weaknesses, and addressing them. By doing so, the path to success becomes clearer (or at least less uncertain).</p>
