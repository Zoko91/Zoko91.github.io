      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was listening to a podcaster named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@theo.lelion&#34;&gt;Theo Lion&lt;/a&gt;, who has a series of videos discussing his entrepreneurial journey. He backs his thoughts with knowledge gained from books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a passionate book lover, but I understood why—I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the chance to read an interesting book. I realized this statement when I started reading Atomic Habits, which Theo Lion recommended. In this first blog post, I will discuss some elements that have helped me become a better person. Understanding key concepts of habits and contextualizing them with personal experiences is essential for becoming more efficient. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Domino, share your activity, get motivated</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-domino-&#34;&gt;What is Domino ?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Domino (the app final name is still under research and development) is an app created to enhance one&amp;rsquo;s experience of going outside. Let&amp;rsquo;s define a new term called &lt;em&gt;instant tourism&lt;/em&gt; by looking into what the app offers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The app is centered around a main function, placing activities on a map. Whenever you are going to the skatepark with friends, attending an old car gathering or even sipping a drink near the beach, you are free to share this activity by placing a pin on the map and describing few information&amp;hellip; The goal is to motivate people to go outside and do activites they would have never done otherwise. It works best when in a foregn country or travelling to a place you haven&amp;rsquo;t meticulously prepared your tight planning. It gives you hints on where to eat, what to do, or find exceptional events on a 2h time-frame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deep Language Identification</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/school-projects/deep-language/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/school-projects/deep-language/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DeepLanguage project was part of my second-year computer science studies at ENSC. The objective was to develop an artificial intelligence capable of identifying spoken languages from short audio clips. With the rise of voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, as well as the need to transcribe and translate text into different languages, language identification is becoming increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The project’s goal was to design a system that could analyze spoken language and identify whether the audio was in French, English, German, or Spanish. The project presented several challenges, including processing large datasets, developing an effective machine learning model, and creating a user-friendly web application to test the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Palette your emotions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/school-projects/palette/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/school-projects/palette/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palette your emotions&lt;/strong&gt; is a project born out of the second-year TransPromotion initiative at ENSC. The goal of the project was to create an innovative tool that would generate a color palette based on emotions and sentiments extracted from text. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and emotion-color theory, we aimed to bridge the gap between human emotions and visual representation through color.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-and-approach&#34;&gt;Concept and Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind Palette was simple yet ambitious: use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the sentiment of a text input and convert those emotions into corresponding colors. We explored existing research on the relationship between emotions and colors and studied how modern tools like OpenAI’s GPT-3 could help us perform sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
